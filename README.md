# ExeterCourseNodeGraph
Literally just graphing all of the available University of Exeter undergraduate and master's courses using a node graph. After selecting a course, you'll be able to find a path from years 1-4 fo the courses you'd like to take as though it were a skill tree (taking into account prerequisites).
